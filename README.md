Data model documentation - describes the components (objects) of the data model and their properties. The data objects are described by a data dictionary, listing each objectsâ€™s properties (fields), with their name and a description. 
A Data Dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data objects that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project.

Description of data model: A project comprises one or more datasets. Each dataset contains a core of events (deployments) defining the location and duration of an event and additional event properties. The event core is extended by information about the organism that is acting during the event, one or more instruments used during the event, one or more sensors used during the event, extended measurements or facts linked to the event (deployment), and the data records collected during the event.
